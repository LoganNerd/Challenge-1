# Challenge-1
First challenge project!

The internet can be accessed by anyone now and we need to make sure our website can be understood by everyone. I added alternate attributes to images so a dictation software will read out the description of an image to a vision impared visitor. I also made the code easier to read for a software developer by consolidating repeating css elements as shown below:
