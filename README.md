# Challenge-1
the start to my first challenge

<h1> The project: </h1>
<p> In this project I was given starter code that needed to be rebuilt to meet accesability standards. The internet can be accessed by anyone now and we need to make sure our website can be understood by everyone. I added alternate attributes to images so a dictation software will read out the description of an image to a vision impared visitor. I also made the code easier
